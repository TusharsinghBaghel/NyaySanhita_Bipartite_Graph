Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and the consent of thewoman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act."

Except murder, and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is anoffence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time ofdoing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwisebe the consequence:Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonableapprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation bywhich he became subject to such constraint.Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of beingbeaten, joins a gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of thisexception, on the ground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything thatis an offence by law.Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instantdeath, to do a thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take histools and to force the door of a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to thebenefit of this exception."

B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in theabsence of A and thereby causes Z’s death.
